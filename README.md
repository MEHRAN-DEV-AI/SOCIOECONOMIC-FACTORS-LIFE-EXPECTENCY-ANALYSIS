# Overview
 This repository contains an analysis of the Life Expectancy dataset, exploring various health and demographic indicators across different countries from 2000 to 2015. The dataset includes information on life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, alcohol consumption, GDP, and more. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebook.
